I want to build a complete web-based progress claim tracking system for subcontractors and project admins using React + Supabase inside Replit.

Please start from scratch. I’m deleting the current app and want you to build this cleanly, step by step.

🔧 Tech Stack:
React (SPA)

Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage)

Vite (if supported)

TailwindCSS (optional, but preferred for styling)

react-router-dom for routing

✅ Core Features:
User login via Supabase Auth (email + password)

AuthGuard to protect dashboard and all project data

Project creation: name, total value, GST %, retention %

Claim management per project:

Claim number, % complete, status

Auto-calculation: this claim, total, GST, retention

Variation tracking per claim:

Description, amount (+/−), status (Pending/Approved/Rejected)

Attachments (optional, stored in Supabase Storage)

File upload support for claims (PDFs, images)

PDF export of each claim (optional step)

🧱 Page Structure:
/login: login form

/: dashboard with list of projects

/project/:id: view claims for project, add new claims

/project/:id/claim/:claimId: view full claim + variations

📁 Components to create:
AuthGuard.jsx — protects routes from unauthenticated access

ProjectForm.jsx — create project form

ProjectList.jsx — list of all user projects

ClaimForm.jsx — create a claim and auto-calculate fields

ClaimList.jsx — list all claims for a project

VariationForm.jsx — form to add variations to a claim

VariationList.jsx — list of variations per claim

FileUploader.jsx — upload files to Supabase Storage

📦 Supabase Schema (use SQL Editor):
users: id, email, role, created_at

projects: id, name, total_value, gst_rate, retention_rate, status, created_by

claims: id, project_id, number, status, percent_complete, previous_claim, this_claim, total_ex_gst, gst, total_inc_gst, retention_held, created_by, created_at

claim_items (optional): description, contract_value, percent_complete, previous_claim, this_claim

variations: claim_id, description, amount, status, created_at

attachments: claim_id, file_name, file_url, uploaded_by

Enable Row Level Security and set policies so users can only see their own projects, claims, and variations.

🧠 Flow:
User logs in → sees projects

Creates project → adds claims under project

Enters % complete → system auto-calculates financials

Can add variations and attachments

Can export claim to PDF later (optional)

Start by setting up the folder structure, Supabase client, and a clean working login screen. Then walk me through each module step by step. Ask before generating each group of files.

Let’s begin with a clean React + Supabase app. You're the lead dev.
